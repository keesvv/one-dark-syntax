## Plutonium Syntax Theme

## Forked from one-dark-syntax
I forked the syntax highlighting theme called 'One Dark Syntax' just to add the finishing touches
to a couple of elements. Brighten up some colors, lighten some colors or just completely change the lot.

### Install

You can install __Plutonium Syntax__ by going to __File > Settings > Install__ and then search for `plutonium-syntax`. Then hit __Install__ and you can select the theme by clicking on __Themes__ on the left of your screen and then select __Plutonium__.
