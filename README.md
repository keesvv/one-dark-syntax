## Plutonium Syntax Theme

![plutonium-syntax](https://i.imgur.com/eR1e7rI.png)

> There is also a matching [UI theme](https://atom.io/themes/one-dark-ui).

## Forked from one-dark-syntax
I forked the syntax highlighting theme called 'One Dark Syntax' just to add the finishing touches
to a couple of elements. Brighten up some colors, lighten some colors or just completely change the lot.

### Install

This theme is installed by default with Atom and can be activated by going to the __Settings > Themes__ section and selecting it from the __Syntax Themes__ drop-down menu.
